Hello everyone, I want to share with you our projects;

- _ChatUIConsoleApp_ : We did some simple Console writing methods and basic If method but I am sure you like it.
- 
- _NumberGuessingGameConsoleApp_ : We did while loop, if-else conditions. this is really good experience for me.
- 
- _StudentAttedanceConsoleApp_ : We did lots of things in this project.
    - First of all **List** , this is usefull when you want to keep data in a List.
    - foreach loop, when you use List your project, foreach definitely efficient loop. It iterator your list item and tell him what you want to do..
    - Nested if-else conditions, this is my project but our senior did it very efficient ways and I will share you ASAP.
